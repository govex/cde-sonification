Accessed vector polygon boundaries of ACS (American Community Survey) Places using the Tigris R package, which presents these boundaries as sf (simple feature) objects.\n3.

We employed the Whittaker-Henderson method of graduation (λ = 1/2 ; d = 2) to obtain a smooth Q curve for ages 0 to 85 years. Extrapolations for the population over 85 years were performed using the Heligman-Pollard (HP2) mortality law. Model parameters were fitted within the age range [55, 85), with extrapolation to 100 years old blended with the smoothed fit over the range [70, 83). This approach aligns with the NCHS methodology, which selects the age of 100 as the endpoint (age at the end of life) for life expectancy calculations.

To score block groups, the block groups were placed into 20 quantiles by variable value (quantiles are groupings with equal numbers of records), each containing 5 percent of the total block groups. \n    - The block groups were then assigned a rank from 1 to 20 depending upon their quantile position.
