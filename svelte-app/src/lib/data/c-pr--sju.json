Accessed vector polygon boundaries of ACS (American Community Survey) Places using the Tigris R package, which presents these boundaries as sf (simple feature) objects.\n3. Used the Terra R package to create spatRaster and spatVector objects. These objects are a special data.frame class containing multi-layer raster data and geometries, respectively, along with associated descriptive attributes.\n4. Projected the geometries of the spatVector objects to match the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the spatRaster objects. This is done using the `terra::project()` function to ensure alignment between raster and vector data.\n5. Within the spatVector objects, we used the ALAND and AWATER attributes, representing the area of land and water, respectively, contained within each polygon boundary to calculate the percent area of land contained within each Place boundary.\n6. For each raster image, we created masks for every city using the corresponding polygon boundary. These masks will define the areas of interest within the raster images.\n7. Summed the pixel values within each mask. This will provide an aggregate value for the percent canopy coverage within the defined boundaries of each city.\n8. Calculated the maximum total pixel sum possible, assuming every pixel value within the mask is 100, representing 100% tree coverage in that 30m x 30m area.\n9. Multiplied the max total pixel value by the fraction of land contained within the boundary. This adjustment accounts for the actual land area within the boundary and provides a realistic maximum pixel value.\n10. Divided the sum value for each city by the adjusted max pixel value to obtain the fraction canopy cover for each city. This will represent the percentage of tree canopy coverage within the city's boundaries.\n11.

We employed the Whittaker-Henderson method of graduation (λ = 1/2 ; d = 2) to obtain a smooth Q curve for ages 0 to 85 years. Extrapolations for the population over 85 years were performed using the Heligman-Pollard (HP2) mortality law. Model parameters were fitted within the age range [55, 85), with extrapolation to 100 years old blended with the smoothed fit over the range [70, 83). This approach aligns with the NCHS methodology, which selects the age of 100 as the endpoint (age at the end of life) for life expectancy calculations. Finally, these interpolated and extrapolated values were inserted into the state curves where mortality rates were absent.

To score block groups, the block groups were placed into 20 quantiles by variable value (quantiles are groupings with equal numbers of records), each containing 5 percent of the total block groups. \n    - The block groups were then assigned a rank from 1 to 20 depending upon their quantile position.
