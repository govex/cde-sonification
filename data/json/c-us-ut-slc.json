To score block groups, the block groups were placed into 20 quantiles by variable value (quantiles are groupings with equal numbers of records), each containing 5 percent of the total block groups. \n    - The block groups were then assigned a rank from 1 to 20 depending upon their quantile position. The ranked scores were then combined using a weighted formula. \n- Then, we linked census block groups to their corresponding city using the geographic boundaries from the 2019 Census Tigris. \n- This crosswalk was then used to extract Walkability Index scores for block groups associated with each city.\n- Finally, we calculated the median walkability index score across all block groups for each
